# I'm Hiba! 👋

I’m a **Media Science student** passionate about **digital creativity, storytelling, and modern technology**. I enjoy exploring how media, design, and AI can combine to create impactful experiences.  

Recently, I participated in the **AI Genesis Hackathon**, which boosted my confidence in using AI tools for smart, innovative projects.

I love experimenting with **visual design, editing, and digital tools**, and I’m always excited to **learn, grow, and expand my creative and technical abilities**.
